# A MUSHRA test for SNR-Based Inter-Component Phase Estimation Using Bi-Phase Prior Statistics for Single-Channel Speech Enhancement

## Introduction

A forked version of [audiolabs/webMUSHRA](https://github.com/audiolabs/webMUSHRA) configured for conducting the MUSHRA test for [1].

## Contents

* [Configuration](gui/configs/default.yaml) and [audio files](gui/configs/resources/audio) used for the test.
* [Data](matlab/icpr_mushra_data.mat) collected from 14 listeners.
* [MATLAB script](matlab/icpr_mushra_analysis.m) for statistical analysis of MUSHRA data, utilized in [1] to generate Figure 9, Tables III, and IV.
